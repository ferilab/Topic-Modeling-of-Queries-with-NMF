# Topic-Modeling-of-Queries-with-NMF

Here we show how to do topic modeling on a huge dataset including more than 400 k questions by customers. We will
use TF-IDF and None_Negative Matrix Vectorization for this project. The number of topics is quite deliberate, we will
define twenty topics. Note that after extracting the most commonly used words in each topic, defining the title of 
the topic based offf of that would be also deliberate and related to our field knowledge and judgment.
